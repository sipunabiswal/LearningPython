# LearningPython
learning python basic programs.

On day 15 of the course, I will show you how to install and set up PyCharm, the most popular Python local code editor.

In the meantime (between day 1 and day 15) we will be using Replit a browser-based code editor. This has a number of advantages:

1. We can get up and running immediately, with less time wasted on setup and troubleshooting, more time learning to code.

2. It's accessible anywhere, any computer/iPad/phone that's connected to the internet can be used to code.

3. Your code and progress are saved, ready for you to review and revisit at any time.

4. It's free.
